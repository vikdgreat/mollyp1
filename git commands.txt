1)	Locate version control system(LVCS) 
           -is your home pc 
problems- lose your laptop
 2)     Centralized vicsion control system (CVCS)
         -is a storage repo where you save your versions
             problem with CVCS --uploading and downloading code is time exhasted

ted version control system (DVCS)
     - combination of local and centralized version control system

git Architecture

 vikdgreat1 is the working directory 
file goes from working directory to staging area which is a temporary 
storage to keep file to be put in local repo

all file in staging area (waiting area)goes to local repo (store the file in local repository) 
LOCAL repository have v1 v2 v3

directory is a folder 
repository is a storage.

				LAB in gitbash
create files in git bash 
# touch is a command to creat file 

git status is to check the file/status of git 
all file all in working directory and awit to be pushed to staging area.

       git status
red : file in working directory and backed
green : file in staging area
Nobody: file in local repository

Before we push file to staging area. we need to infor git who is working
	 2)git config --global user.name victor
 	3)git config --global user.email
	4)git git config --list (see ur name and email0 press q to quit
	( create blank file in staging 
	5)touch file1 file2 file3 file4
	6)Git status   ( will give you the status of ur git repo)git status
	7)get add. --> will put all files from Dir to the staging area.
             (get add file name move only file to staging area)
		(green is staging area)
  
 8)git commit -m" created newfile
   (this command move file from staging area to local repo)
 git status: nothing to commit
9) make some chages in file1 n file2 in the folder
10)git status you see file1 and file2 are modified
11) git add . (files move back to staging area)
12) git commit -m"second commit
12) git status

13) git loggit log ( this will give the log of your commit)
14)git log oneline  ( this will give imp details of log on oneline)


####################ignoring file in git################

15) create a file : 
	touch error.log
   (git status)
16)touch .gitignore 
17)open .gitignore file in the folder and add error.log in .gitignore
18)git status and error.log is gone

add .gitinore to staging to local repo
19) git add .
20) git commit -m"put the gitignore to local repo)

modify error.log in the folder and check status and nothing will show cuz 
it ignoring error.log
  got copy error.log file time and modify the file
check status and you will see error.log been modified
to stop the error coming up 
go to .gitignored file and add *.log (save)
check statue in git and errors gone 
git add .  and commit .gitignored to local repo
